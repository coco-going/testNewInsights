### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Azure Functions Consumption Plan**: Pay only for execution time
2. **Azure OpenAI Token Management**: Implement response caching and prompt optimization
3. **SQL Database Scaling**: Start with Basic tier and scale based on usage
4. **Resource Group Management**: Implement proper resource tagging and cost monitoring
5. **M365 Agents SDK**: Leverage included licensing with Microsoft 365 subscriptions

### Management and Maintenance

#### DevOps Implementation
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
3. **Monitoring**: Application Insights with custom dashboards
4. **Alerting**: Proactive monitoring for failures and performance issues

#### Operational Procedures
1. **Backup Strategies**: Automated database backups and point-in-time recovery
2. **Security Updates**: Regular patching and security assessments
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Regular performance reviews and optimization
